Spent time trying to figure out how to get RGraph bar charts in the
AOR_Chart.php file to not be stuck as a square ratio. There is a lot of space to
the right which it isn't taking advantage of.

I tried both hardcoding a larger width, even though that isn't a perfect
solution, that didn't even work.

Better would be a resizable chart which I spent sometime researching but
couldn't figure out yet.

This linke https://www.rgraph.net/blog/how-to-get-a-responsive-canvas.html is
relevant but doesn't seem to be exactly what we are looking for.
