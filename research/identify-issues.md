Prompt: After discussing with Jot we identified that getting this crm easily
deployable is one obvious goal, but we have been struggling to understand what
else to do. We came to the conclusion that identifying issues on suite crm's
open source issue tracker would be a good place to pull work from, improve the
product, and familiarize ourselves with the code base all at once.

Answer: After reviewing many of the issues I have identified a solid chunk that
are worth more closely looking at / actually working. Please note that this is
not a totally arbitrary list of issues just pulled at random, these are issues
that fit the scope, difficulty, and relevance that we need for this project.
