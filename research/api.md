Question: Does suite crm expose its functionality via an API or is that
something we could implement.

Answer: Suite crm does in fact have an API. In fact they have multiple version
dating back a few years. The most recent one is a json api. The nature of a crm
lends itself to general implementation and as such general exposure. The api
functions over modules (objects / resources) and relationships. Meaning users
can create new modules and new relationships and link them as well as query and
report on them.

While suite crm itself is mobile friendly already this enables other client
applications and services to leverage the data within suite crm.
